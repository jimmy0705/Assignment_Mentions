# Enhancements:

1. If I had more time, I would have added TypeScript to the project for better code structure. Also, I would have used the React Test Library to thoroughly test the Mention component. Both of these are new to me, so I wanted more time to get comfortable with them.

2. Currently, the styling is done right in the code. With more time, I would have made it more organized and easier to manage in the future.

3. I believe the Mention component could be more organized and reusable. Given the chance, I would have refined its structure to make it versatile for different uses.

4. I would have coded the project to match the Figma design down to the finest detail.
